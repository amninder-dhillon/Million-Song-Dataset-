# Predict Song Popularity
## Introduction
In this project, I will be using machine learning to classify a song as popular or not popular. The dataset used in this project is called [million song dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). As the name suggests, dataset contains one million contemporary music tracks from 1920s to 2010.
