# Predict Song Popularity
## Introduction
In this project, I will be using machine learning to classify a song as popular or not popular. The dataset used in this project is called [million song dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). As the name suggests, dataset contains one million contemporary music tracks from 1920s to 2010.
## Getting Started
In order to run the jupyter notebook, you will need csv file with all the data in it. You can get that file from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hfub80ykvonhecg/msd_summary.csv?dl=0). Place this file in assets directory, then you can run the jupyter notebook. 
If you just want to look at the results then take a look at the [slides](https://github.com/amninder-dhillon/PredictingSongPopularity/blob/master/assets/Predicting_Song_Popularity.pdf)
